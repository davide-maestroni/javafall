/**
 * This annotation is used to decorate methods that are to be invoked in an asynchronous way.<br/>
 * Through this annotation, it is possible to set a specific invocation ID for a single method.
 * <p/>
 * Note that the piece of code inside such methods will be automatically protected so to avoid
 * concurrency issues. Though, other parts of the code inside the same class will be not.<br/>
 * In order to prevent unexpected behaviors, it is advisable to avoid using the same class fields
 * (unless immutable) in protected and non-protected code, or to call synchronous methods through
 * the framework as well.
 * <p/>
 * Finally, be aware that a method might need to be made accessible in order to be called. That
 * means that, in case a {@link java.lang.SecurityManager} is installed, a security exception might
 * be raised based on the specific policy implemented.
 * <p/>
 * Remember also that, in order for the annotation to properly work at run time, you will need to
 * add the following rules to your Proguard file (if employing it for shrinking or obfuscation):
 * <pre>
 *     <code>
 *
 *         -keepattributes RuntimeVisibleAnnotations
 *
 *         -keepclassmembers class ** {
 *              &#64;com.gh.bmd.jrt.android.annotation.Id *;
 *         }
 *     </code>
 * </pre>
