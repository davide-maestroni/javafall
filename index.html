<p>Parallel programming on the go.</p>

<h2>
<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>Inspired by the Go routines, this library provides a powerful, flexible, yet familiar concurrency framework, designed to make multi-threads programming simple and funny.</p>

<p>The main paradigm is based on routines and channels. A routine is the container in which a piece of code is executed asynchronously. It takes care of the synchronization and manages the invocation lifecycle. The channels are means of communication between the routine and the outside world.</p>

<p>A routine can be invoked in a synchronous, asynchronous and parallel way. The main difference between the asynchronous and the parallel invocation is that, in the former, all the input data are processed by the same invocation instance, while, in the latter, each input item is (potentially) processed by different instances. For example, if the sum of the inputs has to be computed by the routine, an asynchronous invocation is the way to go, while, when the routine is used to compute, for instance, the square of a number, all the inputs can be safely processed in parallel.
After the invocation, the routine returns an input channel which is used to pass the input parameters. Input data can be passed in bulk or streamed, delayed or fetched asynchonously from another channel. When done with the input, the channel is closed and returns an output channel used to read the invocation results.</p>

<p>The main way to define a routine is to implement an invocation object. Though, the library provides several other ways (always backed by invocations) to call any method of any object, even defined in third party source code, asynchronously in separate threads.</p>
