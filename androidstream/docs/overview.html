<a href="https://github.com/davide-maestroni/jroutine" target="_blank">Parallel programming on the go.</a>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
    Android customization of stream-like routine concatenation based on the <a href="http://davide-maestroni.github.io/jroutine/javadoc/6/stream" target="_blank">JRoutine-Stream</a> library.
</p>
<h2>Main concepts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://davide-maestroni.github.io/jroutine/javadoc/6/androidstream/com/github/dm/jrt/android/v11/stream/LoaderStreamBuilder.html">LoaderStreamBuilder</a>
        <p>
            A stream builder allows to concatenate routines and consumers so to create a processing chain backed by a routine.
            Each routine in the chain may have its own configuration and invocation mode, and might be configured to run inside a Loader in a specific Android Context.

            Each routine in the chain may have its own configuration and invocation mode, and might be configured to run inside a Loader in a specific Android Context.
            This class is specifically meant to employ the Android Support library for retro-compatibility.

<h2>Usage examples</h2>
<p>
    The code below shows how it is possible to load an image from the network in a background thread, by letting the library automatically handle any change in the configuration.
    Note that the very same examples can be re-written using JRoutineLoaderCompat class and a FragmentActivity.
</p>
<b>Example 1:</b> via loader stream.
<p>
    Note that, in order to avoid leaks, the functions are instantiated within a static scope.
