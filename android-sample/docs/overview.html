<p>
    Sample integration of <a href="http://square.github.io/retrofit/" target="_blank">Retrofit</a> based on the <a href="http://davide-maestroni.github.io/jroutine/javadoc/7/android" target="_blank">jroutine-android</a> libraries.
</p>
<p>
    This module provides a sample app showing how to employ the JRoutine library to asynchronously perform a network request inside a dedicated loader.<br>
    The invocation will survive any configuration change (e.g. rotation).<br>
    The example also provides two different methods so to be able to cache or refresh the response coming from the remote server.
