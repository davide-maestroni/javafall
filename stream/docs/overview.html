<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
    Stream-like routine concatenation based on the <a href="http://davide-maestroni.github.io/jroutine/javadoc/6/core" target="_blank">JRoutine-Core</a> library.
</p>
<h2>Main concepts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://davide-maestroni.github.io/jroutine/javadoc/6/stream/com/github/dm/jrt/stream/builder/StreamBuilder.html">StreamBuilder</a>
        <p>
            A stream builder allows to concatenate routines and consumers so to create a processing chain backed by a routine.
            Each routine in the chain may have its own configuration and invocation mode.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Main classes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="http://davide-maestroni.github.io/jroutine/javadoc/6/stream/com/github/dm/jrt/stream/JRoutineStream.html">JRoutineStream</a>
        <p>
            Utility class acting as a factory of stream builders.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://davide-maestroni.github.io/jroutine/javadoc/6/stream/com/github/dm/jrt/stream/modifier/Modifiers.html">Modifiers</a>
        <p>
            This utility provides several methods to create functions transforming a routine stream.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage examples</h2>
<p>
    The code below shows how it is possible to implement the computation of the root mean square of some input data, by distributing it in a number of background threads.
</p>
<b>Example 1:</b> via stream builder.
<p>
    The library provides an additional fluent notation to compose routines.<br>
    Note that the passed instances are expected to behave like functions (that is, no variable state and no side effects).<br>
    The lambda notation used in the example is just for demonstration purpose. In order to compile with Java 7 or below, explicit object creation must be employed.<br>
    In fact, the interfaces defined in the "function" package are conceptually <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html" target="_blank">functional interfaces</a>.
