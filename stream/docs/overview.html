<p>
    Stream-like routine concatenation based on the <a href="http://davide-maestroni.github.io/jroutine/javadoc/6/lib" target="_blank">JRoutine</a> library.
</p>
<h2>Usage examples</h2>
<p>
    The code below shows how it is possible to implement the computation of the root mean square of some input data, by distributing it in a number of background threads.
</p>
<b>Example 1:</b> via stream channel.
<p>
    The library provides an additional fluent notation to compose routines.<br>
    Note that the passed instances are expected to behave like functions (that is, no variable state and no side effects).<br>
    The lambda notation used in the example is just for demonstration purpose. In order to compile with Java 7 or below, explicit object creation must be employed.<br>
    In fact, the interfaces defined in the "function" package are conceptually <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html" target="_blank">functional interfaces</a>.
