<p>
    Implementation of a Java annotation pre-processor used to generate classes used as proxy of other objects so to support asynchronous calls of the wrapped method.<br/>
    The generated classes will be based on the <a href="http://davide-maestroni.github.io/jroutine/javadoc/proxy" target="_blank">jroutine-proxy</a> library, so be sure to include it as a dependency when employing this pre-processor.
